## Code for Publication

In this repo, we provide source data, trained models and NN-derived phenotype map suppliment to the [Modeling mutational effects on biochemical phenotypes using convolutional neural networks: application to SARS-CoV-2.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.28.428521v3): Bo Wang & Eric R. Gamazon*. 

### Model Engine
Our four Deep Learning Models: LR, FCNS, GCNS, CNNS were trained under nn4dms engine - [Neural networks for deep mutational scanning data](https://github.com/gitter-lab/nn4dms) where installation specs well-instructed.
