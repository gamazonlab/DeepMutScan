In general, we use the default 'heat' color palette (to encode kernel density estimation) in scatter plots or UMAPs.

For the LR_vs_GCN_* files, which shown the comparison between linear regression and graph convolutional neural networks, we use the 'bl2gr2rd' color palette, with or without contours.

For heatmaps, the color gradients are included.
